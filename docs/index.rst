Comet
=====

`VOEvent <http://www.voevent.org/>`_ is the `International Virtual Observatory
Alliance <http://www.ivoa.net/>`_ standard for describing transient celestial
events.  Comet is an implementation of the `VOEvent Transport Protocol
<http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/Notes/VOEventTransport/>`_, which provides a
mechanism for fast and reliable distribution of VOEvents to the community.
Comet enables you to subscribe to and act upon real-time streams of ongoing
events, to use filters to select only events relevant to your science case and
to publish your own events to the global VOEvent backbone.
